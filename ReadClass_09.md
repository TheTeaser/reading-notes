## Dunder Method

The purpose of dunder methods is to give developers a way to customize the behavior of their own objects or to let you emulate the behavior of built-in types so that they can make them behave like built-in types. This makes it possible to create classes that feel more natural and intuitive to use.
 
 an example:

```
def containsNum5():
    if x __contatins__ 5:
        return true
```
## AI Guru

The main ethical issue raised was that the AI Guru, who was selling a paid course, had used code and content created by other developers without their permission or without giving them proper credit which is a crime known as intellactual theft.

This issue could've been avoided simply by either asking the owners fro their permission or by creating a code of your own.
