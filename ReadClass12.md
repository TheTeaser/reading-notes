## Pandas Library

Pandas library is a popular open-source data analysis and manipulation tool for the Python programming language. It provides high-performance data structures, tools for data cleaning, reshaping, and analysis, and visualization capabilities.

Common opertaions which are done using Pandas:

1- **Data Reading/Writing**.

2- **Data selection and manipulation**.

3- **Data representation and visualisation**.

Pandas makes it easy to perform complex data manipulations by providing a powerful and flexible toolset for data analysis and manipulation.

## Pandas Datastructure

The two primary data structures in Pandas are Series and DataFrame.

1- **Series:** typically used for representing a single variable or a time series of a single variable. 

2- **DataFrame:** used for storing and manipulating multiple variables that are related to each other.

## Pandas DataFrame 

Loading a dataset into a Pandas DataFrame involves reading data from a file or another source, such as a database, and converting it into a tabular format that can be manipulated using Pandas functions.

Pandas supports a wide range of file formats, including CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL, and more. The most common file formats used for data analysis and manipulation are CSV and Excel.

To load data from a CSV file, we can use the read_csv() function and to load data from an excel file, we can use the read_excel() function.
