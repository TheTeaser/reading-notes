## Stacks and Queues

### Definition: 

A stack & Queues are  data structures that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

### WHY:

Stacks and queues are fundamental data structures used in computer programming and computer science in general. They are used to manage data in a way that allows for efficient processing and retrieval of information. Understanding how they work and their differences can help you write more efficient and organized code.

### WHAT:
 A *stack* is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, which means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

 A *queue*, on the other hand, follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, which means that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. 

### Vocabularies:

1- **Data structure:** a way of organizing and storing data in memory.

2- **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO):** a principle followed by a stack where the last element added is the first one to be removed.

3- **First-In-First-Out (FIFO):** a principle followed by a queue where the first element added is the first one to be removed.
