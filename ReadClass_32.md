# Reading Topics #32: DRF & SQL

## DRF Permissions and how they help in securing APIs:

The key components of DRF permissions and their purposes are as follows:

1. Authentication:

    - Authentication refers to the process of verifying the identity of a user. DRF provides various authentication schemes such as token-based authentication, session-based authentication, OAuth, and more. By configuring the appropriate authentication scheme, you can ensure that only authenticated users can access the API endpoints.

2. Permissions:

    - Permissions control what actions a user can perform on specific resources or API endpoints. DRF provides different types of permissions, including:
   - IsAuthenticated: Allows access only to authenticated users.
    - IsAdminUser: Restricts access to admin users only.
    - AllowAny: Allows unrestricted access to any user, even if unauthenticated.

    -   Custom Permissions: You can define your own custom permissions based on specific criteria relevant to your application.
3. Object-level Permissions:

    - DRF also supports object-level permissions, where access to individual objects within a resource can be further restricted based on certain conditions. For example, you can define permissions that only allow a user to modify or view an object if they are the owner of that object.

DRF permissions help in securing an API in several ways:

1. Authentication ensures that only authenticated users with valid credentials can access the API endpoints. This helps protect sensitive data and prevents unauthorized access.

2. Permissions allow you to define fine-grained access control for different types of users. You can restrict access based on user roles, group membership, or other conditions. This helps enforce business rules and ensure that users can only perform authorized actions.

3. Object-level permissions provide an additional layer of security by controlling access to individual objects. This allows you to implement more granular control over the resources, ensuring that users can only interact with objects they have permission to access.

## SQL SELECT statment:

In SQL, the SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a database. Its primary purpose is to query and retrieve specific columns or expressions from one or more tables in the database.

To retrieve all columns from a table called 'employees', you can use the following SELECT statement:

```
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

## DRF Generic views:

The role of DRF Generic Views is to simplify the development process by abstracting away common operations, reducing boilerplate code, and promoting code reusability. They allow you to focus on defining the data models, serializers, and customizing behavior, rather than implementing repetitive CRUD operations.

few examples of DRF Generic Views:

1. ListAPIView:
This view allows you to retrieve a list of objects from a model.

2. RetrieveAPIView:
This view retrieves a single object from a model based on a unique identifier.

3. UpdateAPIView:
This view updates an existing object.
