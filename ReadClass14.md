## *Comparison:*

**1- Matplotlib:** It offers low-level control over every aspect of a plot, making it highly customizable but requiring more code to create complex visualizations.
Matplotlib is a good choice for creating basic charts, line plots, scatter plots, histograms, and custom visualizations.

*Example:* A line plot showing the stock prices of different companies over time would be well-suited for Matplotlib.

**2- Seaborn:** Seaborn simplifies the process of creating complex visualizations and offers several built-in themes and color palettes for enhancing the aesthetics of the plots.
It specializes in statistical visualizations such as distribution plots, regression plots, categorical plots, and heatmaps.

*Example:* Creating a kernel density estimation plot (KDE) to visualize the distribution of a numeric variable across different categories would be a suitable use case for Seaborn.

**3- Bokeh:** Bokeh provides an intuitive and concise API for creating interactive plots with capabilities like zooming, panning, and hovering over data points.
It is designed to handle large and streaming datasets efficiently, making it suitable for creating real-time visualizations and dashboards.

*Example:* Creating an interactive scatter plot where clicking on a data point reveals additional information about the data point would be a good use case for Bokeh.

## *Main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots in Seborn?*

***Relational Plots:***

1- This function creates a scatter plot to display the relationship between two numeric variables.

2- This function creates a line plot to show the trend of one numeric variable over another


***Categorical Plots:***

1- This function creates a bar plot to display the relationship between a categorical variable and a numeric variable. 

2- countplot(): This function creates a bar plot to show the count of occurrences of each category in a categorical variable.

***Distribution Plots:***

1- histplot(): This function creates a histogram to visualize the distribution of a single numeric variable.

2- violinplot(): This function creates a violin plot to display the distribution of a numeric variable across different categories.


## *The Seaboen Cheat-Sheet:*

The Seaborn Cheat Sheet serves as a valuable quick-reference resource for Python developers working with the Seaborn library. 

It provides an overview of key functionalities and features, allowing developers to quickly access and apply the appropriate Seaborn functions in their data visualization workflow.

Here some key functionalities:
