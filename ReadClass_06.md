In these topics, I was introduced to the random module and its functions, which might be helpful in my next lab.

## Random Module

**How can the random module be utilized in Python to generate random numbers or make selections from a list, and what are some common functions available within the module?**

By using the function within the Random module we can create random number in many different ways and it all depends on the scope, there are mulitple function and methods to choose from, here is some:

1- **random()** - This function returns a random float between 0 and 1, including 0 but not including 1.
2- **randint(a, b)** - This function returns a random integer between a and b (inclusive).
3- **choice(seq)** - This function returns a random element from the given sequence (e.g., list, tuple, or string).
4- **shuffle(seq)** - This function shuffles the given sequence (e.g., list, tuple, or string) in place.
5- **sample(seq, k)** - This function returns a list of k unique elements chosen randomly from the given sequence (e.g., list, tuple, or string).

## Risk Analaysis

**what is risk analysis?**

is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test.

**what are the key steps involved in conducting a risk analysis for a software project?**

1- **Risk Identification** - he first step in conducting a risk analysis is to identify all the potential risks that could arise during the software development process.
2- **Risk Assessment** - Once potential risks have been identified, the next step is to evaluate the likelihood and impact of each risk.
3- **Developing strategies to mitigate or avoid risks** - After assessing the risks, the next step is to develop strategies to mitigate or avoid each risk.

## Test Coverage

**Definition:**

Test coverage is a measure of the extent to which a set of test cases covers the code and functionality of a software application. It is used to assess the effectiveness of the testing process and to identify any gaps in the testing that may exist.

**Why is it important?**

  it helps to find which bits of your code that aren't being tested and needs additional care. 
  People focus on coverage numbers because they want to know if they are testing enough and effectively.


## Big O Notation

**Definition:**

Big O notation  is a mathematical way of describing the time complexity of an algorithm.

**How is it used?**

To analyze an algorithm and determine its Big O notation, you need to understand its structure and the number of operations it performs. For example, let's say you have an array of integers and you want to find the maximum value. One way to solve this problem would be to iterate through the array and compare each element with the current maximum value. 
To analyze that algorithm's complexity, you need to count the number of operations it performs. Then if it's an array for example (where n is the size of the array), which is a linear operation. Therefore, that algorithm has a complexity of O(n).

**An example:**

A common example is washing dishes, for an instance you have multiple plates that you need to wash 1 by 1 in this case the time you need to to wash all the plates is bound to the number (n) of plates that you are going to wash, hence, washing dishes has the complexity of O(N).
