## Serverless Computing:

Serverless computing is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and automatically provisions and scales the resources required to run an application. The key characteristics of serverless computing include:

1- **No server management**

2- **Event-driven architecture**

3- **Scalability and elasticity**

## Vercel Intro:

To get started with Vercel and deploy a serverless function, follow these main **steps**:

1- Sign up for a Vercel account: Visit the Vercel website (vercel.com) and create an account. You can sign up using your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account for authentication.

2- Install Vercel CLI (Command Line Interface): The Vercel CLI allows you to deploy projects from the command line. Install it by running the appropriate command for your operating system. You can find detailed installation instructions in the Vercel documentation.

3- Initialize your project: Open your project's directory in a terminal or command prompt and run the vercel init command. This command will guide you through the initialization process and create a vercel.json configuration file in your project directory.
 
4- Configure your project settings: Modify the vercel.json file to specify your project settings. This includes specifying the build command, output directory, and other deployment configurations. For serverless functions, you need to define the functions you want to deploy in the vercel.json file.

5- Write your serverless function: Create the serverless function you want to deploy. The function can be written in any supported programming language, such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, etc. Ensure that your function follows the requirements and structure defined by Vercel for the chosen language.

6- Deploy your serverless function: Run the vercel command in your project directory to deploy your serverless function to Vercel. The CLI will build your project, bundle the necessary files, and deploy them to the Vercel platform. It will provide you with a unique URL for your deployed serverless function.

## APIs:


APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of rules and protocols that define how different software applications can communicate and interact with each other. They allow developers to access and manipulate data or functionality provided by external systems, services, or platforms.

In Python, APIs can be utilized in applications to access and manipulate data from external sources using various libraries and frameworks.


## Requests Library:

The Requests library is a popular and user-friendly Python library used for making HTTP requests. It simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests, handling headers, parameters, and processing responses from APIs. The Requests library supports various HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., and allows you to pass data and headers with the requests.

an example:

```
import requests

url = 'https://api.example.com/data'  # Replace with the actual API endpoint

response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()  # Assuming the response is in JSON format
    # Process the retrieved data
    print(data)
else:
    print('Request failed with status code:', response.status_code)
```
