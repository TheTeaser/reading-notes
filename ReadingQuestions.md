# Reading Topic
I found these topics extremely usefull as it reminded me of what I've learned back in university, the Big O for example is very important for the perfomance aspect of coding, Pain Vs. Suffering gave me a headsup for what is coming (Winter is coming) & I now the differnce between mutable and immutable datatypes.

## Pain vs. Suffering

Python learning can be overwhelming in numreral ways in life including but not limited to:

1. Mentally   
2. Physically
3. Emotionally 

Attempting to comprehend the vast amount of knowledge that comes with accelerated learning of Python may prove mentally taxing and overwhelming.

Add to that the exhaustation of countless hours of learning and implementing.

Not to mention the frustation of different scenarious such as: Not understanding the code/bug/error/...etc

But I will to counter that by doing the following:

- Keep my self entertained and focused while learning to ease the pressure of work.
- Try to Half of the labs work in the same day of the lecture to ease the task.


## Big O

Time complexity is a measurement of how long an algorithm takes to run based on the size of the input data set and it is represented using Big O notations such as O(1)/ O(N)/ O(2^N) and so on.

On the other hand,space complexity is used to measure how much memory an algorithm needs for it to run based on the size of the input data and also uses Big O notations to describe it.

## Names and Values in Python

Mutable Values: Are datatype that you can remove/add/change it's elements and examples on these datatypes: List/Dictionaries.

Immutable Values:  Are objects that can't be modified after their creation such as Integers/Float/Strings/Tuples/etc.


## Things I want to know more about
How to effectively calculate and how to choose the best algorithem depending on my function.
