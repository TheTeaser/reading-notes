# Hash Tables:

## Why:
Hash tables are used in computer science and software engineering to efficiently store and retrieve data. They provide a way to map keys to values, enabling quick access to information based on a unique identifier. Hash tables are particularly useful when we need to store and retrieve data in constant time, regardless of the size of the data set.

## What:
A hash table, also known as a hash map, is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to values. It consists of an array (or a dynamic array) and a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash code, which is an integer value. This hash code is used as an index to store the value in the array.

In a hash table, the array is typically larger than the number of elements to be stored, allowing for efficient handling of collisions (when two different keys produce the same hash code). Each element in the array is often referred to as a "bucket" or a "slot" and can hold one or more key-value pairs.

## How:
Here's a step-by-step process of how hash tables work:

1. When inserting a key-value pair into a hash table, the hash function is applied to the key, producing a hash code.

2. The hash code is used as an index to determine the bucket or slot in the array where the value will be stored.

3. If the bucket is empty, the key-value pair is stored directly in the bucket. If the bucket is not empty (a collision occurs), various strategies can be used to handle it, such as chaining or open addressing.

4. Chaining: In chaining, each bucket holds a linked list or some other data structure to handle multiple key-value pairs that have the same hash code. Colliding elements are appended to this list.

5. Open addressing: In open addressing, when a collision occurs, the algorithm searches for the next available bucket in the array using a predefined probing sequence. This process continues until an empty bucket is found.

6. To retrieve a value from the hash table, the key is again hashed using the same hash function.

7. The hash code is used to locate the appropriate bucket in the array.

If chaining is used, a search is performed within the linked list in the bucket to find the desired key-value pair.

If open addressing is used, the probing sequence is followed until either the key is found or an empty bucket is encountered.

Once the key-value pair is found or an empty bucket is reached, the value can be retrieved or an appropriate action can be taken.

It's important to note that a good hash function is crucial for a hash table's efficiency. An ideal hash function should distribute the keys uniformly across the array to minimize collisions and provide fast access to values.
