# Engineering Readings

**What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?**

I bring positivity with guidance; I am known to uplift the mood and to guide others on what to do both technically and life-wise.

**What are 3 things I’ll start doing to "unstick" myself whenever I get stuck on a tough piece of code, logic, or feature?**

1. Change my environmental scenario.

2. Ask a teammate for his view on this matter.

3. Find another approach to solving the problem at hand.
