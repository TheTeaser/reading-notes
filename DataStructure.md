# Data Structure & Algorthim

**What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?**

The problem's requirements, such as the type of data to be stored, the expected size of the data, the operations to be performed on the data, and the performance requirements of the solution.

**How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?**

by defining a base case or a condition that breaks out the function, (Break point).
