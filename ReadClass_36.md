# Reading Topics #36: DSA Review

## Whiteboard Advices:

**Some Advices for a whiteboard interview that might help you:**

1. Restate the question: Before diving into solving the problem, restate the question to demonstrate your understanding. Seek affirmation from the interviewer to ensure you have a clear grasp of the problem.

2. Ask about edge cases: Consider potential edge cases related to the problem and ask the interviewer about them. This showcases your analytical thinking and attention to detail.

3. Ask about test cases: Inquire about specific test cases or examples that your solution should pass. This demonstrates your understanding of the importance of testing and helps clarify the expected behavior of your code.

4. Write pseudocode and discuss it: Instead of immediately writing code in a specific programming language, start by writing pseudocode. This allows you to focus on the logic and high-level structure of the solution. Discuss your pseudocode with the interviewer, seeking feedback and clarifying any potential issues.

5. Write the actual code: Once you have a solid understanding of the problem and have discussed your pseudocode, proceed to write the actual code. Don't hesitate to ask the interviewer if your solution looks good or if they have any suggestions for improvement.

## Increase Whiteboard Performance:
**Here is two strategies to increase your peformance in the whiteboard interview:**
1. Take a few minutes to think: Rather than immediately jumping into talking and attempting to solve the problem while under pressure, take a few minutes to gather your thoughts. After the interviewer explains the problem and you ask any clarifying questions, take a moment to think through the basics of the problem and decide on an approach. Communicate to the interviewer that you would like a minute or two to think about the problem, and then start talking. This allows you to gather your thoughts, come up with a plan, and provide a more thoughtful and structured response.

2. Write down the steps of the solution: Before starting to write the actual code, write down the general steps of how you will solve the problem on one side of the whiteboard. This serves as a roadmap for your solution and helps you organize your thoughts. It also allows the interviewer to see your high-level thought process and approach. Focus on getting the steps in order and making them somewhat readable. This step-by-step outline helps you stay organized and ensures that you don't miss any important components of the solution.

- By taking the time to think and plan before diving into coding, and by visually outlining the steps of your solution, you can approach the whiteboard interview in a more structured and organized manner, improving your overall performance.

## Gayle Laakmann McDowell Take on Whiteboard Preparation:

As the speaker stated if the candidate has prepared for the given question and was over confident while providing an answer without taking time to deconstruct  nor think in the way of solving the question, the interviewer should give him another challenge which is harder than the previous one, as the reason from whiteboard questions is to test the  problem solving skills of the candidate and the ability to comprehend new problems and initate a proper way of deconstructing it.
